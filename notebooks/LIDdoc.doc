                <h4>DRAMATIS PERSONAE</h4>
                
            
                <p>Basilio King of Poland.</p>
                
            
                <p>Segismund his Son.</p>
                
            
                <p>Astolfo his Nephew.</p>
                
            
                <p>Estrella his Niece.</p>
                
            
                <p>Clotaldo a General in Basilio's Service.</p>
                
            
                <p>Rosaura a Muscovite Lady.</p>
                
            
                <p>Fife her Attendant.</p>
                
            
                <p>Chamberlain, Lords in Waiting, Officers,</p>
                
            
                <p>Soldiers, etc., in Basilio's Service.</p>
                
            
                <p>The Scene of the first and third Acts lies on the Polish frontier: of the second Act, in Warsaw.</p>
                
            
                <p>As this version of Calderon's drama is not for acting, a higher and wider mountain-scene than practicable may be imagined for Rosaura's descent in the first Act and the soldiers' ascent in the last. The bad watch kept by the sentinels who guarded their state-prisoner, together with much else (not all!) that defies sober sense in this wild drama, I must leave Calderon to answer for; whose audience were not critical of detail and probability, so long as a good story, with b, rapid, and picturesque action and situation, was set before them.</p>
